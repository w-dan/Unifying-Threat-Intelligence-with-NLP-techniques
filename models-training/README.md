This folder contains several experiments that were performed for training models.

It includes:

* Several model tests (Llama3, BERT, RoBERTa, etc.)
* Testing various datasets
    * Clauses
    * Full reports
    * Vendor-specific

They were all documented in jupyter notebook files, since a graphic interface made it easier to extract graphic resources like confusion matrices or plots.

Models that performed favourably were saved and loaded in the final `../mapper/mapper.py` script.
